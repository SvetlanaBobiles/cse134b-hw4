      <h1>Projects</h1>

   <p>
      As of now I don't have any (personal besides school) but I wanted to 
      add this page as it is important to include for a portfolio type website.
   </p>

   <h2 class = "intro">Purpose</h2>
   <p>
      In this section I would talk about the purpose of the project and describe what it does.

   </p>

   <h2 class = "intro">Code</h2>

   <p>
      In this section I would link the repository or show code inlines.

   </p>

   <h2 class = "intro">Demonstration</h2>

   <p>
      In this section I would show the end result or how the application works
